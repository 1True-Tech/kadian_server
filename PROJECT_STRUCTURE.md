# Kadian E-commerce Platform - Project Structure Report

## Overview
Kadian is a modern e-commerce platform built with a microservices architecture, consisting of a Next.js client application and a Node.js backend server. This document outlines the server-side architecture, key components, and security implementations.

## Architecture

### Server Structure
The server follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```

├── app/                  # Application entry points and route logic
│   ├── index.js          # Main Express application setup
│   └── routerLogic/      # Route handlers organized by domain
├── controllers/          # Business logic controllers

```

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- JWT-based authentication with access and refresh tokens
- Role-based access control (user/admin roles)
- Account lockout after failed login attempts
- Secure password storage with hashing

### Security Features
- Enhanced HTTP headers with Helmet
- Dynamic request size limits
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- Structured logging with Pino
- CORS protection with strict configuration

### Database
- MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- Separate database connections for different domains
- Robust schema validation

### API Structure
- RESTful API design
- Modular route organization by domain
- Consistent error handling

## Data Models

### User Model
- Authentication credentials
- Personal information
- Shopping cart
- Wishlist
- Address management

### Product Model
- Product details
- Pricing information
- Inventory management

### Order Model
- Order tracking
- Payment information
- Shipping details

## Security Implementation

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits credentials
2. Server validates credentials
3. If valid, generates access and refresh tokens
4. Access token used for API authorization
5. Refresh token used to obtain new access tokens

### Authorization
- Role-based permissions
- Permission-based access control
- Route protection middleware

## Development Practices
- Environment-specific configurations
- Structured error handling
- Comprehensive input validation
- Secure coding practices

## Future Enhancements
- Payment processing integrations (Stripe, PayPal)
- Enhanced admin capabilities
- Improved server-side rendering
- Additional security hardening
