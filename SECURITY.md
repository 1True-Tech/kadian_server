# Security Implementation Guide

## ‚úÖ Implemented Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization
- ‚úÖ JWT-based authentication with access tokens
- ‚úÖ Role-based access control (admin/user)
- ‚úÖ Protected routes with `requireAuth` and `allowedRoles`
- ‚úÖ Password hashing with bcrypt (12 salt rounds)
- ‚úÖ Strong password requirements (uppercase, number, symbol, min 8 chars)

### Route Security
- ‚úÖ **Admin-only routes:**
  - `GET /orders` - View all orders
  - `PATCH /orders/:id` - Update order status
  - `DELETE /orders/:id` - Permanently delete orders
  - `POST /inventory/_refresh` - Refresh inventory
  - `PATCH /inventory/:productId` - Update product info
  - `PATCH /inventory/:productId/:sku/stock` - Update stock levels

- ‚úÖ **User authentication required:**
  - All `/auth/me/*` routes (user profile, cart, wishlist)
  - `GET /orders-by-user` - View own orders (with admin override)
  - `POST /orders` - Create orders
  - `GET /orders/:id` - View order details
  - `DELETE /orders/:id/cancel` - Cancel orders

- ‚úÖ **Public routes:**
  - `GET /health` - Health check
  - `POST /auth/login` - User login
  - `POST /auth/register` - User registration
  - `GET /inventory` - View inventory
  - `GET /inventory/:productId` - View product details
  - `GET /inventory/:productId/:sku` - View SKU details

### Security Middleware
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting (100 requests/15min general, 5 requests/15min auth)
- ‚úÖ Security headers (XSS protection, CSRF, clickjacking prevention)
- ‚úÖ CORS configuration with origin restrictions
- ‚úÖ Request size limits (10MB)
- ‚úÖ Content Security Policy

### Data Protection
- ‚úÖ Password exclusion from API responses
- ‚úÖ JWT token verification
- ‚úÖ User data isolation (users can only access their own data)
- ‚úÖ Admin privilege escalation for cross-user operations

## üö® Critical Security Fixes Applied

### 1. Authorization Bypass Fix
**Issue:** `/orders-by-user` allowed any user to access other users' orders by providing `userId` parameter.
**Fix:** Users can now only access their own orders; admins can access any user's orders.

### 2. Missing Authentication
**Issue:** Several routes lacked authentication requirements.
**Fix:** Added `requireAuth: true` to all sensitive operations.

### 3. Inventory Management
**Issue:** Inventory updates were unprotected.
**Fix:** Restricted to admin-only access.

## üîí Additional Security Recommendations

### Environment Security
- [ ] **URGENT:** Remove `.env` from version control
- [ ] Use environment-specific secrets management
- [ ] Rotate JWT secrets regularly
- [ ] Use stronger, randomly generated secrets

### Database Security
- [ ] Enable MongoDB authentication
- [ ] Use connection string without embedded credentials
- [ ] Implement database-level access controls
- [ ] Enable audit logging

### Production Security
- [ ] Enable HTTPS/TLS
- [ ] Use a reverse proxy (nginx/Apache)
- [ ] Implement proper logging and monitoring
- [ ] Set up intrusion detection
- [ ] Regular security audits

### Code Security
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (using Mongoose helps)
- [ ] Implement refresh token rotation
- [ ] Add password reset functionality with secure tokens
- [ ] Implement account lockout after failed attempts

### Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Log authentication attempts
- [ ] Monitor for suspicious activities
- [ ] Set up alerts for security events
- [ ] Implement audit trails

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Testing

### Test Cases to Implement
1. **Authentication Tests:**
   - Invalid token handling
   - Expired token handling
   - Role-based access verification

2. **Authorization Tests:**
   - Cross-user data access attempts
   - Privilege escalation attempts
   - Admin-only route protection

3. **Rate Limiting Tests:**
   - Verify rate limits are enforced
   - Test different IP addresses
   - Verify rate limit headers

4. **Input Validation Tests:**
   - Malformed JSON payloads
   - Oversized requests
   - Special characters in inputs

## üìã Security Checklist for Deployment

### Pre-deployment
- [ ] Remove all hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Update CORS origins for production
- [ ] Enable HTTPS
- [ ] Configure proper error handling (don't expose stack traces)
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting

### Post-deployment
- [ ] Verify all security headers are present
- [ ] Test authentication flows
- [ ] Verify rate limiting is working
- [ ] Check logs for any security issues
- [ ] Perform penetration testing

## üö® Immediate Actions Required

1. **Remove `.env` from git:**
   ```bash
   git rm --cached .env
   git commit -m "Remove .env from tracking"
   ```

2. **Generate new JWT secrets:**
   ```bash
   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"
   ```

3. **Update production CORS origins** in `app/index.js`

4. **Set up proper secrets management** for production

## üìû Security Incident Response

If a security issue is discovered:
1. Immediately assess the scope and impact
2. Implement temporary mitigations if possible
3. Document the incident
4. Apply permanent fixes
5. Review and update security measures
6. Conduct post-incident analysis
